    <p>This is a project made by investors, for investors.  A platform to discuss investment strategies is key to understanding the market, and unlike others, our site was made 
      with stock investing in mind.  Unlike forum posts, we allow you to import live stock data through tickers, and let you use them however you like.  As an example you can 
      search for a ticker you like, and select the range of dates you would like to see from it.  Double click to reset the ticker to its lifetime ticker.</p>
