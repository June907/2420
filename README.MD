## Project Instructions

  

The following is a link to our project. It's hosted using Amazon Web Services, and utilizes all-free tiers to support our needs.

  

http://twofortwenty-dev.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com

  ## Local Setup

Because of the nature of our AWS RDS instance, connection to the Postgres database used for the project is limited to only those with manually-inserted IPs on the management account.

  

Even then, another added layer of security is our private .credentials file, which includes database connection information for the app as well as the Django project secret key.

  

As such, running a local version of the app is ultimately impossible, but the full range of functionality is available through the hosted link.
